            <h2>Matt</h2>
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <h4>Robert Morris University Library</h4>
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/rmu.edu/rmu-library/" target="_blank"></a>
            <h4>(See images of the website in the img folder)</h4>
            <p>The Robert Morris University Library webpage is heavily text-based, the home page is almost completely devoid of imagery aside from the RMU logo. The style is consistent throughout the entirety of the website. I don’t personally belive the website makes a good use of space, as it seems like there is a lot of empty white space that could have been utilized better or at least styled in a better way</p>
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <li>The homepage has an area that students can use to ask for help in a prominent placement on the webpage, which is good for students who need help with something relating to the library.</li>
            <li>The navigation handily separates and effectively categorizes the different types of media that students may seek out.</li>
            <li>The layout is simplistic and does not cause any confusion, it is easy to take a quick look at the page and find simple information like library hours and the search function. The visual design of the search pages for the "Books and eBooks" and "Media" is very appealing.</li>
            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
            <li>The visual design of the homepage and the Databases page are very plain and boring, they has a white and red color scheme that isn’t very engaging to a viewer. There is also some formatting issues on the home page with text coming too close to the edges of the box around it at certain points.</li>
            <li>The visual design is not consistent between the home page and the variious search pages.</li>
            <li>Despite being a useful aspect of the website, the Can We Help You section is not very visually appealing, as well as uses some confusing icons. The audio icon and the share icon seem unnecessary. </li>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Based on the preceding analysis, in creating a new design for the Pittsburgh Technical College Libray, our designers should consider avoiding certain features exhibited by these competitors, such as bland and uninteresting visual design, poor formatting and inconsistent design across various pages. However, we would be wise to imitate beneficial features, such as simplistic layouts with essential information prominently displayed, and categorized media to help keep the different media formats the library would have available distinct from one another.</p>

            <p>Competitive Analysis</p>
            <h3 class="competitiveanalysis">Competitive Analysis - Springdale Public Library</h3> 
            <a href="https://www.springdalepubliclibrary.org" target="_blank"></a>
            <p>The landing page of the Springdale Free Public Library does well to display important information for the user, such as upcoming events. However, the site does not do well at having a balance of information in the body compared to sidebar information and decreases the use of images on sub pages. However, there is some inconsistency in the layout of several sections. The creators would do well to make the website have a consistent layout.</p>
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>List hours the library is open along with contact information throughout website</li>
                <li>The site was made by WordPress - making it easy for the client to manage</li>
                <li>Upcoming events are listed on the landing page - this lets the user know what’s happening in the library</li>
                <li>Sidebar information throughout the site which gives the user necessary information such as hours and contact information</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The events page is not consistent on they layout - different style altogether </li>
                <li>Does not have many images throughout the site </li>
                <li>Some pages - such as the contact page - only lists the address and phone number, making the page have more information in the sidebar than on the body of the page</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="competitiveanalysis">Competitive Analysis - mMrcyhurst University </h3> 
            <a href="https://library.mercyhurst.edu" target="_blank"></a>
            <p>The website for the Mercyhurst Library has a balance of images to the body text, consistent styling of the header, and site structure. The style does change in many sections. They include different navigation, different sidebar information, and inconsistent spacing. These differences could prove confusing to the user.</p>
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Consistent header style and page organization through the site</li>
                <li>Balance of images to text throughout the site</li>
                <li>Good use of spacing and balance between body content and sidebar information</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Once visiting the research section, the website appears to use a new layout with more navigation with entirely different style</li>
                <li>Navigation on the research section is poorly spaced with too many links - links are responsive but on small screens, become many rows decreasing the call to action area</li>
                <li>The information in the sidebar changes throughout the website and sometimes is gone altogether</li>
            </ul>
